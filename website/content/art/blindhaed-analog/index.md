This series of analog photographs is part of the BLINDHÆD exhibition, capturing moments from the installation that explores the transformation of vision through technology. These images document the physical elements of the artwork, including the event camera installation, laser-etched screens, and the interplay between human and machine.

The analog photographs serve as a counterpoint to the digital event-based vision technology featured in BLINDHÆD, creating a dialogue between traditional photographic methods and cutting-edge computer vision techniques. These images capture the tangible, material aspects of the installation, grounding the speculative exploration of enhanced vision in physical reality.
