### Performance by Aqua Veen
> Part one is the procedure. Aqua Veen will perform an example of the procedure to the audience, in which audio synthesis is used to probe a self-referential embodiment of the human visual system. In this system, a Projector and a Beholder create a transient and ephemeral audio-visual connection. The performance is an attempt to calibrate this relationship amidst the landscape of radio frequency interferences present in this space.
>
> In the second part of the performance, we see the consequences of the procedure: the human emerges from it with an altered perception. The attention is drawn to the video wall in which the human perception shifts towards a neuromorphic reality. Event-based camera systems generate a continuum of data in microtemporal timeframes. This data is intercepted by computer vision algorithms that directly control the duo’s musical instruments. Whereas in the first part, human-controlled instruments are only modulated by the probing process, in the second part, the system is given autonomy to generate audio signals, placing the human performers in a supervisory role.

### Curatorial Text by [Dana Melaver](http://www.danamelaver.com/)

> An empirical dream of enhanced vision, of seeing with a machine. "Blindspot" is a poetic exploration of what we could but cannot yet see, filmed using neuromorphic event-based camera systems which are able to visualise beyond our fallible eyes. Unfolding as a dance between human and machine, the film imagines the future of vision as hybridised.
> 
> The universe comes into existence when it's met by human eyes. From faraway planets to bacteria and DNA, concepts enter the collective human psyche once they come to be visible. If that which eludes us is what is beyond our sight, then the promise of upgraded vision is really the promise of unexplored territories. But as we look towards the future with cyborgian eyes, we might recall the story of Icarus, caught up in the sunlight. Beyond a film, "Blindspot" is as well a sculpture, composed of four monitors uniquely scarred by laser etching. The laser, concentrated light, is as well a warning of all too powerful sight; in its power it burns.
