My second vinyl recording revolves around ambient, IDM, and acid-house. We begin with industrial sounds by Berlin-based producer Kobosil. The Canadian synthwave-duo Le Matos ties in with the opening of their soundtrack for the motion picture "Turbo Kid": a voice sets the dystopic and post-apocalyptic theme of the film. Bicep then continue with more hopeful yet decelerating sounds with a track from their self-titled album.

We continue with British music from Aphex Twin's long-awaited sixth studio album "Syro". With his track "XMAS_EVET10 (thanaton3 mix)", he demonstrates his multi-layered style once more. B12 then expand on the track's complexity with "Obtuse" &ndash; a fast-paced piece with sharp synth sequences. Bicep's "Vespa" is a distorted interlude that calls contemplative and emotive sounds by Burial into memory.

What follows are more vertical sounds at the intersection of acid, techno, and new wave. The contrast between the uplifting synth sounds and seemingly introspective lyrics in Perel's "Alles" strikes me every time. In "Otherman", The Spaceapes's vocals march through a gloomy space: "Words unspoken, physically broken, nations, lost in translation, salacious eyes, green with envy, …" (full lyrics [here](https://genius.com/Kode9-and-the-spaceape-otherman-lyrics)). This recording ends with Burial's "Dog Shelter".
