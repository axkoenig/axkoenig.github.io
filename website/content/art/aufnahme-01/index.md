My first vinyl recording opens with warm sounds by Burial &ndash; one of my all-time favorite artists. With "Hall of Mirrors", we stay in the UK and dive into the early 1990s, an evolutionary era for IDM. B12's Electro-Soma in particular marks one of the foundations of contemporary electronic music in the UK. Tagwell Woods' self-titled track introduces us to darker yet peaceful sounds.

The record "The Last Resort" by Danish artist Trentemøller with its rhythmic track "Nightwalker" played an important role when I first got into electronic music. We drift into more hectic soundscapes with recent releases from the Dutch label De Lichting and the Munich-based labels Ilian Tape and SNC RECS.

The gentle voice of Tom O'Bedlam recites the beautiful poem "The Laughing Heart" by Charles Bukowski in the track "Everything We Call Real". The poem reminds us that our life is our life and that chances will come our way. You can find the original sample [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNmu1Q9NzA). With "Back to Belgrade" which was originally written as the film score of "The Black Panthers", we fast forward in the Warp Records timeline for 24 years. The distant and emotional sounds of Moby's "Lilly" mark the end of this recording.
