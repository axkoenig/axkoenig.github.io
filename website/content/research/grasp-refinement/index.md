For my master thesis in the [Harvard Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.harvard.edu), I investigated the role of tactile sensing in learning and deploying robotic grasping controllers. This research effort was sponsored through a full scholarship by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and by funding of the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

Our work first got published in the [Workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://sites.google.com/view/icra2022-contactrich/) at [ICRA 2022](https://www.icra2022.org). An extended version was later accepted into [IROS 2022](https://iros2022.org/) as a full paper.

This research investigates how tactile feedback can significantly improve robotic grasping performance and provides insights into the role of embodiment in learning systems. Our work demonstrates how tactile feedback enables robots to adapt to different object properties and environmental conditions, leading to more robust manipulation capabilities.

The research was conducted using state-of-the-art soft robotic hands equipped with advanced tactile sensors, allowing for real-time feedback during grasping operations. The results show significant improvements in grasping success rates compared to traditional vision-only approaches.

This work was conducted in collaboration with [Prof. Howe](https://hst.mit.edu/faculty-research/faculty/howe-robert), [Prof. Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu), and [Prof. Menze](http://home.in.tum.de/~menze/).
