Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. The research demonstrates that self-supervised learning can achieve competitive performance with traditional supervised methods while requiring significantly fewer labeled examples.

Our approach leverages contrastive learning and feature clustering to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled image data, enabling effective segmentation without extensive annotation efforts.
