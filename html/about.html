                    I am a master's student in <a href="https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/robotics-cognition-intelligence-msc/">Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence</a> at Technical University of Munich (TUM). I hold a B.Sc. in <a href="https://www.mse.tum.de/en/prospective-students/engineering-science/#c3206">Engineering Science</a> also from TUM. My main interests are machine learning, computer vision/graphics, robotics and medical technology. 
                    Feel free to browse through some of the projects I did in the "research" tab and download a short version of my CV <a href="../downloads/cv.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.
