                <p>Purpose – The impressive advancements of imaging modalities throughout the past decades lead to
                    significant progress in orthopedic research and clinical care. In the diagnosis and treatment of
                    complex bone fractures, Computed Tomography (CT) scanning became an in- dispensable aid. However,
                    surgeons still face a high cognitive load during the osteosynthesis of complex fractures as the
                    intra-operative display of CT data proves to be cumbersome. Mentally transforming images from 2D
                    monitors to 3D surgical space leads to poor ori- entation of surgeons during the fracture
                    reconstruction process. This can result in worse treatment outcomes and increases healthcare
                    expenses. Thus, a rethinking of intra-operative visualization to enhance spatial understanding of
                    orthopedic surgeons is necessary.</p>
                <p><br>Methods – This work follows an Augmented Reality (AR) based approach to the intra- operative
                    visualization of CT data. A pre-operative workflow including the segmentation of the CT data using a
                    medical imaging workstation (3D Slicer) and import into a custom application in a 3D game engine
                    (Unity) is proposed. A commercially available optical see-through head-mounted display (Microsoft
                    HoloLens) is used to display the segmented volumetric models. Through a Graphical User Interface or
                    voice commands, surgeons can select various states with different functionalities to integrate the
                    visualization better into their workflow.</p>
                <p><br>Results – To evaluate the usability and clinical feasibility of the proposed method a statistical
                    analysis of a user study was conducted. Four orthopedic surgeons were invited to take part in an
                    experiment and rate the system using the System Usability Scale (SUS). While on average the SUS
                    score was 81.9, three of four surgeons rated system usability with an average score of 90, which is
                    a promising result. Qualitative data was gathered using comments boxes which yielded meaningful
                    ideas for the extension of the project.</p>
                <p><br>Conclusions – This work shows that the principle of AR can overcome current challenges involved
                    with intra-operative visualization and has great potential in surgical applications. The study
                    suggested that user training before the adoption into operating rooms may be necessary. The
                    extension of the proposed software to incorporate information from a pre- operative planning tool
                    may be sensible, and the further automation of the workflow should be investigated. Through the
                    development of future AR devices with larger fields of view and more advanced technology a paradigm
                    shift in surgical visualization is within reach.</p>
