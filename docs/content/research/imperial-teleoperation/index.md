During my research internship at the [Mechatronics in Medicine Lab](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mechatronics-in-medicine) at Imperial College London, I built a modular ROS platform to intuitively control a robotic rig with a gesture tracker. Visual feedback via a virtual reality headset allows for remote teleoperation of the robot. I also used data from an RGB-D camera to play with ideas regarding autonomous robotic grasping.

The [IEEE RO-MAN](https://ro-man2021.org) conference 2021 accepted our paper on the educational use of this platform. The system demonstrates how gesture-based control can provide an intuitive interface for robotic manipulation tasks, making robotics more accessible for educational purposes.
