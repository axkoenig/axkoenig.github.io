My first vinyl recording opens with warm sounds by Burial &ndash; one of my all-time favorite artists. With "Hall of Mirrors", we stay in the UK and dive into the early 1990s, an evolutionary era for IDM. B12's Electro-Soma in particular marks one of the foundations of contemporary electronic music in the UK. Tagwell Woods' self-titled track introduces us to darker yet peaceful sounds.

The record "The Last Resort" by Danish artist Trentemøller with its rhythmic track "Nightwalker" played an important role when I first got into electronic music. We drift into more hectic soundscapes with recent releases from the Dutch label De Lichting and the Munich-based labels Ilian Tape and SNC RECS.

The gentle voice of Tom O'Bedlam recites the beautiful poem "The Laughing Heart" by Charles Bukowski in the track "Everything We Call Real". The poem reminds us that our life is our life and that chances will come our way. You can find the original sample [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNmu1Q9NzA). With "Back to Belgrade" which was originally written as the film score of "The Black Panthers", we fast forward in the Warp Records timeline for 24 years. The distant and emotional sounds of Moby's "Lilly" mark the end of this recording.

My second vinyl recording revolves around ambient, IDM, and acid-house. We begin with industrial sounds by Berlin-based producer Kobosil. The Canadian synthwave-duo Le Matos ties in with the opening of their soundtrack for the motion picture "Turbo Kid": a voice sets the dystopic and post-apocalyptic theme of the film. Bicep then continue with more hopeful yet decelerating sounds with a track from their self-titled album.

We continue with British music from Aphex Twin's long-awaited sixth studio album "Syro". With his track "XMAS_EVET10 (thanaton3 mix)", he demonstrates his multi-layered style once more. B12 then expand on the track's complexity with "Obtuse" &ndash; a fast-paced piece with sharp synth sequences. Bicep's "Vespa" is a distorted interlude that calls contemplative and emotive sounds by Burial into memory.

What follows are more vertical sounds at the intersection of acid, techno, and new wave. The contrast between the uplifting synth sounds and seemingly introspective lyrics in Perel's "Alles" strikes me every time. In "Otherman", The Spaceapes's vocals march through a gloomy space: "Words unspoken, physically broken, nations, lost in translation, salacious eyes, green with envy, …" (full lyrics [here](https://genius.com/Kode9-and-the-spaceape-otherman-lyrics)). This recording ends with Burial's "Dog Shelter".
