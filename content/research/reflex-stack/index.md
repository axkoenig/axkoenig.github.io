In preparation for my research project on robotic grasp refinement, I created a simulator for a robotic hand using Gazebo, C++, and the Robot Operating System (ROS). This open-source simulation stack also calculates various metrics that are useful for grasp analysis. The package is available as a pre-built Docker container.
