### Abstract
>  Recent progress in robot manipulation can be attributed to two developments: first, the application of novel learning methods, and second, the use of expertly crafted models. Consequently, merging these two developments seems a promising path for further progress. However, this only works if obtaining policies from learning and modeling possess synergistic properties. We argue that this is not necessarily the case. We discuss the reasons and suggest an alternative view of what can accelerate progress in manipulation. We then recall that this alternative view is already well-established in seminal works in robotics and show, based on our own work, that this view continues to produce advances in robotic manipulation.


Below is the accompanying video playlist, where my colleagues and I demonstrate across various manipulation problems, how separting general from task-specific information yields robust manipulation policies.
