At [Merantix Momentum](https://www.merantix-momentum.com/) I worked on the [safe.trAIn](https://safetrain-projekt.de/en/) research project spearheaded by Siemens. Within the project, I investigated reliable and label-efficient computer vision algorithms for semantic scene understanding. We published a follow-up study on STEGO, a self-supervised semantic segmentation method, in the [SAIAD Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/saiad2023) at CVPR 2023 in Vancouver.
