For my master thesis in the [Harvard Biorobotics Lab](https://biorobotics.harvard.edu/), I investigated the role of tactile sensing in learning and deploying robotic grasping controllers. This research effort was sponsored through a full scholarship by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and by funding of the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

Our work was first published at the [Workshop on Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation](https://sites.google.com/view/icra2022-contactrich/) at ICRA 2022. An extended version was later accepted into IROS 2022 as a full paper.
