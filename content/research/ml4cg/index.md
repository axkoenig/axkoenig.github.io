I took part in the Machine Learning in Computer Graphics practical offered by the [Blavatnik School of Computer Science](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/computer) during my stay at Tel Aviv University. In a small team, we developed a new method for self-supervised class and content disentanglement.
