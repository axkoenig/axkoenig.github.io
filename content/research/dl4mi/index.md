I worked on COVID-19 detection from chest radiographs as part of the Deep Learning in Medical Imaging course at the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://en-engineering.tau.ac.il/biomed) at Tel Aviv University.

We compared three approaches: (1) transfer learning with a pre-trained network, (2) anomaly detection using an autoencoder trained on healthy lung images, and (3) multi-task learning of image classification and reconstruction.
